Description: C++ port of ZXing library (development files)
 ZXing-C++ ("zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D
 barcode image processing library implemented in C++.
 .
 It was originally ported from the Java ZXing library but has been
 developed further and now includes many improvements in terms of
 quality and performance. It can both read and write barcodes in a
 number of formats:  QR Code, DataMatrix, Aztec, PDF417, UPC-A, UPC-E,
 EAN-8, EAN-13, DataBar/RSS, Code 39, Code 93, Code 128, Codabar, ITF.
 .
 This package provides development files for zxing-cpp library.
